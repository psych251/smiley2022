# Replication of Smiley & Fisher (2022)

This is the repo for a replication of Smiley and Fisher's (2022) study on perceptions of emerging technologies. 

(The template this is based on contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.)
