## Introduction

### A short justification for your choice of experiment in terms of your research interests or research program (1 paragraph). This justification should tell us why you chose this particular result.

Despite the idiosyncracies of various technological developments, there
is a fundamental human fear of new technologies, from the radio to the
television to the smartphone. Because my research investigates people's
perceptions of digital media, I found this paper relevant because it
probes a potential mechanism underlying cycles of tech panic:
endorsement of the status quo. In their Study 1, Smiley and Fisher
(2022) experimentally manipulated participants' age at the time of an
obscure technology's invention (15 years before vs. after the invention
of the technology) and measured participants' self-reported perceptions
of the technology's societal impact. Smiley and Fisher (2022) found that
participants in the born-after condition evaluated the technology more
positively than those in the born-before condition.

### A description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to
conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be (1-2
paragraphs).

The stimuli for this experiment are descriptions of an obscure technology called aerogel, "a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas without significant collapse of the gel structure." The authors selected this technology because it was possible to manipulate its perceived age without too many participants knowing its actual date of invention. In the born-before condition, participants were told that aerogel was invented 15 years after they had been born, with the exact year dynamically populated based on the participant's birth year. (For example, a participant born in 2000 would read that aerogel was invented in 2015.) In the born-after condition, participants were told that aerogel had been invented 15 years prior to their birth. (So a participant born in 2000 would see that aerogel was invented in 1985.)

review that your repo is formatted right and look at the original paper.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%,
95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for
selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known
demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the
text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote
directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the
original article.

### Procedure

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in
quotations and note that this was followed precisely. Or, quote directly
and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original
article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively
for an analysis strategy section. The key is to report an analysis
strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data
exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.

**Clarify key analysis of interest here** You can also pre-specify
additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and
analysis plan from original study. The goal, of course, is to minimize
those differences, but differences will inevitably occur. Also, note
whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on
claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the
conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data
collection.

#### Actual Sample

Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in
analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary
result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it
replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original
result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from
follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the
replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the
differences between original and present study ones that definitely,
plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and
(c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and
original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be
long.
